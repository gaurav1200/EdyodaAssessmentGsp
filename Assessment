Assessment 1
we use demone pod when we have to use a pod in the in all nodes same time

Assessment 2

we can use rolling update it removes the old pod and creates new pod on same time before terminating old pod it creates new pod
we will patach minimumread kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": xxx}}'y seconds to the deployment 
and then
----$kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": xxx}}'
 then we will perform set image command so it will update to this image in the update
----$set image deployment xxx
then it will gradually change from previous version to new version

Assessment 3

1 we should check if the service is accessable within cluster or not 
2 if it is accessable then its ok
3 if it is not accessable then we have to check that weather application is running and working within container itself if not it's application problem
4 if it is running in container we have to check then the yaml file with we have created the service there we will check weather we have used correct selector or not 
5 and keep the port above 30000
